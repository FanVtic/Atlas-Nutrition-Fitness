# Atlas-Nutrition-Fitness
Atlas Nutrition and Fitness website was built using HTML, CSS, Python and MySQL. It provides users the ability to input and track their exercise and meal progress. 

This Application/Website was built relying on APIs from API Ninjas that could pull the data for meals, exercises and calorie tracking based on a users input. This project demonstrates a great understanding of full stack software development and the technical implications of building full stack websites and applications.
